=====================
multiple inheritance is possible in JAVA 
by using interfaces 
reason:
mainly because of methods do not have method body (method definition)
interfaces only have method declarations.


multiple inheritance is NOT possible in JAVA 
by using classes.
reason: Two independent parent classes can have any method signature and if a child class tries 
to access the parent it will get confused which parent class method it tries to access.


-------------------------------------------------------------
abstract classes 
even if one of the method is marked as abstract then the whole of the class should be marked as abstract.

abstract classes can not be instantiated means you can not create a object out of a abstract class.

interfaces can not be instantiated means you can not create a object out of a interface.
